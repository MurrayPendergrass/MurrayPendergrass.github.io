# Interests
* Negative Socioeconomic Outcome Prevention - Preventing individuals from experiencing negative socioeconomic outcomes such as homelessness is more humane and cost-effective than waiting to assist people only after they have reached the negative outcome, such as losing their homes. Data science can be an effective tool in combating this issue.

* Indigenous Empowerement  - As a descendant of the Blackfeet Nation, I have a vested interested in using my time and resources to advocate for Indigenous people and empower Indigenous voices. 

* Climbing - I enjoy recreating in the mountains in many ways, from skiing to trailrunning, but my primary interest is alpinism - climbing large technical peaks via ice and rock climbing.
